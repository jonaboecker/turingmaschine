# This is the first example machine given by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper
#   "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to
#    the Entscheidungsproblem".
# It simply writes the endless sequence 0 1 0 1 0 1...

# (Turing uses the convention of leaving a gap after each output cell,
# reserving it for marking the cell. For instance, on a tape that
# contains '0 1x0 0 1 1y1y0y', x marks the leftmost 1 and y marks 110.)
